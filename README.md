# Figma Lab: From Code to Design

## Welcome!
You've been building websites with HTML and CSS - now it's time to see how designers create the visual blueprints that developers bring to life. In this lab, you'll learn Figma through hands-on exercises that connect directly to your web development experience.

---

## Getting started

### Create your figma account
1. Go to [figma.com](https://figma.com) and sign up for free using your google account
2. You will see a page like in the screenshot below:

![img](./assets/figma-landing-page.png)

3. Click the `Design` button in the tool bar on the top left of the page
4. If you see a different page, it could happen that they have updated this page. Just find the `Design` button

### Your First File
1. Click `Design` and skip any ads you might be seeing. This is creating a new design file for you
2. On the Sidebar, you will see **Untitled** - this is the default file name so feel free to name it anything you want or you change it to "My Figma Lab - [Your Name]"
3. You're now in the Figma editor!

## Exercise 1: The Figma Interface Tour (10 minutes)

### Part A: Get Your Bearings
Think of Figma like your code editor, but for visual design. Let's explore:

**The Canvas** (center area)
- This is like your HTML document - where everything lives
- Zoom: `Ctrl/Cmd + scroll` or use zoom controls (top right)
- Pan: Hold `Space + drag` or use middle mouse button

**The Toolbar** (top)
- Contains all your design tools (we'll use these shortly)
- Think of these like HTML elements you can add

**Layers Panel** (left)
- Like viewing your HTML structure/DOM tree
- Shows all elements on your canvas hierarchically

**Properties Panel** (right)
- Like CSS properties for selected elements
- Change colors, sizes, effects, etc.

### Part B: Create Your First Shape
1. Click the **Rectangle tool** (R) in the toolbar
2. Draw a rectangle anywhere on the canvas
3. Notice it appears in the Layers panel on the left
4. With it selected, look at the Properties panel on the right

**Think About It:** How is this similar to creating a `<div>` in HTML and styling it with CSS?

---

## Exercise 2: Basic Tools & Properties (15 minutes)

### Part A: Shape Tools Practice
Create these elements (think of them as HTML elements you'd style):

1. **Rectangle (R)**: Draw 3 different sized rectangles
2. **Circle (O)**: Hold `Shift` while dragging to make perfect circles
3. **Text (T)**: Click and type "Hello Figma!"
4. **Line (L)**: Draw a simple line

### Part B: The Properties Panel (Your CSS in Figma)
Select your rectangle and explore these "CSS-like" properties:

**Fill** (like `background-color`)
- Click the color square
- Try different colors
- Try gradients from the dropdown

**Stroke** (like `border`)
- Click the + next to Stroke
- Change color and thickness
- Try different stroke positions (inside, outside, center)

**Corner Radius** (like `border-radius`)
- Drag the corner radius slider
- Try different values

**Size & Position** (like `width`, `height`, `position`)
- Change W (width) and H (height) values
- Change X and Y coordinates

### Part C: Typography (Your CSS Font Properties)
Select your text and explore:
- Font family dropdown
- Font size
- Font weight (like `font-weight: bold`)
- Text alignment
- Line height
- Letter spacing

**üí° Pro Tip:** These properties work just like CSS - you're just using a visual interface instead of typing code!

---

## Exercise 3: Build a Simple Card Component (15 minutes)

Let's create something you might actually code - a user card component!

### Step 1: Create the Card Container
1. Draw a rectangle (this is your card container)
2. Size: 300px wide √ó 200px tall
3. Fill: White (#FFFFFF)
4. Stroke: 1px, #E0E0E0 (light gray border)
5. Corner radius: 8px

### Step 2: Add an Avatar
1. Create a circle inside your card
2. Size: 60px √ó 60px
3. Position it in the top-left area of the card
4. Fill: Choose any color (this represents a profile image)

### Step 3: Add Text Content
Create these text elements (stack them vertically):

**Name:** 
- Text: "Sarah Johnson"
- Font size: 18px
- Font weight: Semi-bold

**Title:**
- Text: "Frontend Developer"
- Font size: 14px
- Color: #666666 (gray)

**Email:**
- Text: "sarah@example.com"
- Font size: 12px
- Color: #888888 (lighter gray)

### Step 4: Position Everything
- Arrange elements with proper spacing
- Use the alignment tools in the toolbar to align text
- Leave margins around the edges (like CSS padding)

**üéØ Challenge:** Think about how you'd code this card in HTML/CSS. What elements would you use? How would you structure the CSS?

---

## Exercise 4: Frames & Auto Layout (10 minutes)

Frames are like `<div>` containers that help organize your design.

### Part A: Convert to Frame
1. Select all elements of your card (drag to select or Ctrl/Cmd+A)
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Frame selection" or press Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+G
3. Notice how everything is now contained in a frame

### Part B: Try Auto Layout (Like Flexbox!)
1. Select your frame
2. Press Shift+A or click the Auto Layout button in properties
3. Watch how your elements arrange themselves
4. Try changing:
   - Direction (horizontal/vertical)
   - Spacing between items
   - Padding (like CSS padding)
   - Alignment (like flexbox alignment)

**ü§Ø Mind Blown Moment:** Auto Layout works very similar to CSS Flexbox - it automatically arranges child elements!

---

## Exercise 5: Components & Design Systems (8 minutes)

Components in Figma are like reusable CSS classes - create once, use everywhere!

### Part A: Create a Component
1. **Select your best card design** from the previous exercises
2. **Right-click** ‚Üí "Create component" or press Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+K
3. **Notice the purple outline** - this indicates it's now a master component
4. **Rename it**: Double-click the layer name and call it "User Card"

### Part B: Create Instances
1. **Drag the component** from the Assets panel (left sidebar) onto your canvas
2. **Or copy-paste** the component (Ctrl/Cmd+C, Ctrl/Cmd+V)
3. **Create 3 instances** and arrange them in a row

### Part C: Override Properties
With each instance, you can override specific properties:
1. **Select an instance** (not the master component)
2. **Double-click the text** to edit names, titles, emails
3. **Change colors** of the avatar circles
4. **Notice**: All instances maintain the same structure and styling, but with different content

**üîß Developer Connection:** This is like having a CSS component class that you can reuse with different content - same structure, different data!

---

## Exercise 6: Collaboration Features (7 minutes)

Figma's real power is in real-time collaboration - like Google Docs but for design!

### Part A: Share Your File
1. **Click "Share" button** (top right)
2. **Copy the link** and save it (you'll use this to invite others)
3. **Set permissions**: 
   - "Can view" = Read-only access
   - "Can edit" = Full editing access
4. **Try sharing** with a classmate if possible, or bookmark for later

### Part B: Comments & Feedback
1. **Select the comment tool** (C key or speech bubble icon)
2. **Click anywhere** on your design to add a comment
3. **Type a comment** like: "Should this text be bigger?"
4. **Tag someone** using @ if you shared with classmates
5. **Reply to comments** by clicking on existing comment bubbles

### Part C: Version History
1. **Click the file name** at the top
2. **Select "Show version history"**
3. **See snapshots** of your file at different times
4. **Click any version** to see what it looked like then

**üíº Professional Insight:** In real projects, designers and developers use comments to discuss implementation details, and version history helps track design evolution!

## Exercise 7: Advanced Concepts Preview (10 minutes)

Let's explore some powerful features that make Figma indispensable for web projects.

### Part A: Styles & Design Tokens (Like CSS Variables!)
1. **Select your card's title text**
2. **In Properties panel**, click the "Style" icon (four dots) next to text properties
3. **Click "+"** to create a text style
4. **Name it**: "Card Title"
5. **Apply this style** to other card titles by selecting them and choosing the style

**Now the magic:**
1. **Edit the style**: Right-click the style ‚Üí Edit style
2. **Change the font size** to 20px
3. **Watch all instances update** automatically!

**Color Styles:**
1. **Select a colored element** (like your avatar)
2. **Click the style icon** next to the color picker
3. **Create a color style** called "Primary Blue"
4. **Apply it to other elements**

### Part B: Simple Prototyping (Bringing Designs to Life)
1. **Switch to Prototype mode** (top right tabs: Design | Prototype)
2. **Select your first card**
3. **Drag the blue arrow** that appears to another card
4. **Choose interaction**: "On click" ‚Üí "Navigate to"
5. **Set animation**: Try "Smart animate"
6. **Test it**: Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button (top right)

**You just created an interactive prototype!** This shows developers exactly how interactions should work.

### Part C: Dev Mode Preview (Designer-Developer Handoff)
1. **Click the "Dev Mode" toggle** (top right) if available
2. **Select any element** in your design
3. **See the code panel** on the right showing:
   - CSS properties
   - Exact measurements
   - Color values (hex, RGB)
   - Font specifications

**ü§ù Bridge Builder:** This is how designers hand off pixel-perfect specs to developers - no more guessing games!

### Part D: Auto Layout Advanced (CSS Grid-like Features)
1. **Select your card frame**
2. **In Auto Layout settings**, try:
   - **Wrap**: Makes items flow to new lines (like flex-wrap)
   - **Gap**: Consistent spacing between items
   - **Fill container**: Makes items expand to fill space
3. **Create a grid**: Duplicate cards and watch them arrange automatically
